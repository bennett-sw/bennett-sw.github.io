    Hello! I'm Bennett. I'm a first year <a href="https://economics.princeton.edu/graduate-program/graduate-student-directory/">PhD student in Economics at Princeton University</a>. Before this, I was a pre-doctoral research fellow with <a href="http://davidyyang.com/">Professor David Yang</a> in the Department of Economics at Harvard University. I graduated with a BA in Mathematics-Economics from Columbia University in 2022. </p>
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>

    <p>
    I am interested in issues related to behavioral economics, macroeconomics, and political economy. I generally work on modelling the interplay of cognitive distortions and traditional market mechanisms, often focusing on models of rational inattention. If you'd like to chat, feel free to reach me at <a href="mailto:bennettsw@princeton.edu">bennettsw@princeton.edu</a>.
