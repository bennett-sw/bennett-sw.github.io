    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> 

    Hello! I'm Bennett. I'm a  <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/people/bennett-smith-worthington">pre-doctoral research fellow</a> with <a href="http://davidyyang.com/">Professor David Yang</a>; I'm also an affiliate with <a href="https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/person/bennett-smith-worthington">Harvard's Evidence for Policy Design</a>. I work on issues related to political economy, behavioral economics, the economics of education, and industrial organization. I am interested in how to model the interplay of cognitive distortions and market functionality, and more specifically how traditional economic theory is augmented with the inclusion of imperfect cognition.
