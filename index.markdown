    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> 
    
    Hello! I'm Bennett. I'm a [pre-doctoral research fellow](https://economics.harvard.edu/people/bennett-smith-worthington) with [Professor David Yang](http://davidyyang.com/); I'm also an affiliate with [Harvard's Evidence for Policy Design](https://epod.cid.harvard.edu/person/bennett-smith-worthington). I work on issues related to political economy, behavioral economics, the economics of education, and industrial organization. I am interested in how to model the interplay of cognitive distortions and market functionality, specifically how traditional economic theory is augmented with the inclusion of imperfect cognition.
